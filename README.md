Reflections
================

- I gained a better understanding of array and object operations, including map, filter, reduce, and Object.entries.
- I realized the value of breaking down problems into smaller, manageable tasks and working on each one step by step.
- I learned to approach problems thinking about the desired output and working to find the solution.
